Consider a set of geo-tagged events like location of COVID-19 cases and location of car accidents. One important thing about these events is to tell where is the center of this events? By center we mean the location with maximum number of events. For example in case of COVID-19, in which country, city, or even smaller areas it starts to spread to other places? Another important thing about these events is that how they spread from the center to other locations?
So, in this project we try to find centers of a set of geo-tagged events and their spead/dispersion.
